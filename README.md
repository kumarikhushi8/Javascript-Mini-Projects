JavaScript Projects

These are beginner-level JavaScript projects I created to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling with HTML/CSS + JS.

ðŸ”˜ Project 1: Dark & Light Mode Switcher
A web page that switches between dark and light mode through simple buttons and JavaScript

A fun little simulation where a circle changes color and shadow to act like a bulb turning on and off.

Each click changes the background to a random color using JavaScript logic and loops.
